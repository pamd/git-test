N/A	Donor was a transplant patient who received pancreas and kidney at age 28 after developing end stage renal disease.  A mesenteric cyst in the small bowel was removed at the time of transplantation.  A follow-up ultrasound 6 years after surgery showed the Tx kidney and pancreas to be normal.  7 years after transplant the donor had abdominal pain and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, biopsy of kidney transplant, and biopsy of pancreas transplant.  The donor had a history of Type I Diabetes, hypertension, anemia in chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic retinopathy.	4.10000000e+01	\N	3.90000000e+01	Male	Hispanic/Latino	165	7.16999969e+01	2.62999992e+01	\N	\N	\N	2012-10-11	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Insulin	FK506 4/3mg BID, Mycophenolate 500mg QD, Aspirin, Fluconazole, Hydroxyzine, Methylpresnisolone, Metoclopramide, Mycophenolate mofetil, Pantoprazole, Polyethylene glycol, Senna, Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, Tacrolimus, Valganciclovir, Vicodin	\N	\N	None known	\N	\N	\N	Transplant	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	0	\N	1	WAKE FOREST	\N	\N	1	\N	1	\N
