Per Rita: ""The organ was packaged well, sufficient procurement fluid and ice were included. The pancreas was rather small, as we all may have expected, 39g of weight, 13 cm long. Head and body were extremely soft, whereas the tail was more solid. Part of the head (side) was cut off, but my impression is that the missing tissue was not very big.
Based on the texture of the head and body, quite frankly, an islet isolation would have been a real challenge at this point. Almost all pancreas has been cut and fixed according to Irina's suggestions, for nPOD, and for Vanderbilt. One tube of blood (Plasma) was sent and it is now frozen. Pancreatic lymph-nodes, spleen, non-pancreatic lymph nodes (these last ones received with the package) are in OCT.""  HbA1c from 12/18/2017 23:11"	N/A	Donor was found unresponsive at home after not using insulin pump for a few days prior.  She had nausea and vomiting and slept most of the day prior to being found unresponsive.  EMS found her profoundly hypotensive and she was intubated en route.  Upon arrival to the ED, the donor was pulseless and CPR was initiated with 4 rounds of epinephrine and calcium chloride given.  Total downtime 20 minutes.  She was suspected to have had a prolonged period of hypotension and was hyperglycemic with metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Head CT showed global edema.  Donor started to show signs of compartment syndrome and abdominal ultrasound showed fluid in abdomen.  An abdominal drain was placed.                                                                           The donor had a history of diabetes, Addison's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, migraines, and stomach ulcers.  She had a surgical history of appendectomy.  She had a family history of diabetes (father, maternal grandmother and great-grandmother) and coronary artery disease (maternal great grandfather, father had recent heart attack).	1.87600002e+01	\N	2.00000000e+00	Female	Caucasian	163	6.65000000e+01	2.50300007e+01	1.03000002e+01	5.9999999999999998e-02	Yes	2017-12-18	10:24:00	2017-12-19	15:44:00	2017-12-24	07:33:00	2017-12-18	10:56:00	5.3333333333333333e-01	403	698	Insulin via pump, Novalog	Hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, fludrocortisone, Prilosec	Insulin, Levophed, epinephrine, neosynephrine, hydrocortisone, solumedrol, fludrocortisone, Lasix, metolazone, bumex, thyroxine, Duoneb, Narcan, vecuronium, meropenem, vancomycin, Mucomyst, Levemir, bicarbonate, Benadryl, Kayexelate, heparin	None	Levemir and penicillin	3 drinks x every 2 weeks x 2 months	Marijuana 3 times in last 3 months	None	None	A*01/31, B*08/60, DR*17/04, DQ*02/08	CMV	No	\N	A+	2	Death from Natural Causes	Death from Natural Causes	5.8812499999999996e+00	2.1949999999999999e+01	IIAM	46	\N	\N	0	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	1	\N

He described him as pale/white, but did not feel he was blue. Donor was sleeping in bed with parent when noted to be down. Paramedics found him to be asystolic. CPR was initiated and he was given 5 rounds of epinephrine prior to arriving in the ED. Bilateral tibial intraosseous infusion and supraglottic airway were placed. 5 more rounds of epinephrine, atropine and bicarbonate were given. There was some difficulty securing his airway and took 3 attempts. A 3.0 french uncuffed ETT was placed. There was a significant air leak, but oxygen saturations improved at this point. Total downtime 62 minutes, CPR 54 minutes. ETT became dislodged and patient was reintubated with 3.5 Fr cuffed ETT that took several attempts. Patient developed a mucus plug and had a cardiac arrest requiring pediatric advanced life support (PALS), reintubation, and bronchoscopy. He received 4 rounds of epinephrine and PALS for 11 minutes.

5/7/2010 40 yr old male, who was an unrestrained backseat passenger involved in a high speed MVA in Ecuador. Upon EMS arrival (no EMS Sheet) it was reported that pt had +LOC for an unknown time, pt was assessed to be paraplegic and paraparetic, rt>left. Loss of sensation below T2, C7 fracture, displaced rt femur fracture. Taken to OR for fixation of C-spine and femur fracture repair. Few days later pt developed a fever, was observed to have purulent drainage from neck incision. Returned to OR on 5/14, C-spine hardware removed, 250cc of pus was drained. Due to suspicion of esophageal injury, methylene blue was injected, and leak was noted at incision site. Pt remained A & O, with minimal movement of R&LUE, until hardware was removed on 5/14, and since pt has not been awake. Returned to OR on 5/16, g tube placed, created spit fistula and JP placed in rt neck. On 5/20 Pt was then transferred to Cornell for further medical management, on arrival pt required re-intubation with a King tube. It was reported that pt lost airway en route, emergently taken to OR for open tracheostomy 5/23 Pt was noted to have only a respiratory drive. Head CT was negative for hemorrhage with shift, however due to the
hardware that was placed study was limited. MRI head are consistent with multiple infarcts secondary to hypoxic ischemic injury. Neurosurgery was consulted, Halo placed. No neurology interventions at this time. 5/27 Pt was noted to be areflexic and brain death protocol was started."	4.00000000e+01	\N	\N	Male	Hispanic/Latino	165.1	9.70000000e+01	3.55000000e+01	5.90000010e+00	\N	Yes	2010-05-20	00:00:00	2010-05-26	11:46:00	2010-05-29	23:14:00	2010-05-20	07:15:00	7.2500000000000000e+00	116	160	No	\N	\N	Neck abcess- drained	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	A*02/03, B*07/48, DR*11/14, DQ*07/07	CMV, EBV (VCA) (IgG)	Not done	\N	O+	18	Other	MVA	9.9680555555555550e+00	1.7016666666666666e+01	IIAM	8	Organ Donor	\N	0	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	1	\N	1	\N

Chest X-ray showed 9 mm right pneumothorax, edema, bilateral pulmonary contusions, and right 5th and 6th rib fractures. Abdominal CT showed large grade 4 right hepatic lobe laceration with active arterial bleeding, a small perisplenic hematoma suggestive of a grade 1 splenic laceration, contracted gallbladder, and a small calcification near the cecum possibly representing appendicolith. Head CT revealed extensive cranial, skull base, and orbitofacial fractures including severely comminuted and displaced bifrontal skull fractures with depression of multiple fracture fragments intracranially, and right occipital skull fracture extending to temporal bone. Also revealed intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhages, pneumocephaly, diffuse cerebral edema with uncal and tonsillar herniations, large anterior interhemispheric pseudoaneurysm, and early left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) infarct. Surgery placed a chest tube in the ER to treat pneumothorax. Neurosurgery was consulted for a possible decompressive sub-occipital craniectomy, but it was not performed due to donor being deemed too unstable for neurosurgical OR – he lost pulses and CPR was again required. Achieved ROSC after 4 rounds of CPR and epinephrine. Transferred to PICU. Underwent a cerebral angiography with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) embolization of left ACA and associated pseudoaneurysm. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, with an open abdomen and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) in place.

He stayed at the hospital for one night where he was diagnosed with Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and discharged with a prescription for methyl prednisone with instructions to start it only if the rash got worse. Rash worsened the day before terminal hospital admission so his mother gave first dose of prednisone. He had been awake and talking that morning but experienced a developing headache and photophobia. Mother was later called at work by a sibling who reported the donor was screaming due to the severity of the headache. Donor described headache as feeling like an electric current. Mother returned home to find he was agitated, combative, appeared angry, and began vomiting.

She had been at a state fair and took ecstasy. Her friends reported that she took a full tablet instead of ¼ tablet. She became very thirsty, drinking more than 2L of water (4-5 bottles) in a short period of time. She then began yelling, and was unable to walk without assistance. Her friends helped her to a restaurant where she tried to drink more water but became altered. Her eyes rolled back and she fell and hit her head. When her friends picked her up they noted she was stiff with possible abnormal “shaking or shivering.” Restaurant manager called 911. Initial presentation was awake, alert, and oriented (AAO) x3 upon EMS arrival. While en route to the hospital she became altered/somnolent, her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) deteriorated to 4, and she was observed with shaking/convulsions and possible decorticate posturing. She received Narcan x1, a normal saline (NS) bolus, and was put on a non-rebreather (NRB) at 1-2% with O2 saturation improvement from 88% to 99%. She had a GCS of 3 on arrival to the hospital, and was intubated. Received a 23.4% saline bolus for an initial sodium level of 120. Chest CT/Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, with consideration for acute lung injury. Also showed near complete bilateral lower lobe collapse, bilateral upper lobe atelectasis, and bilateral layering pleural effusions. Nonspecific gallbladder wall edema and small amount of fluid around pancreas and kidneys was also noted. Head CT/CT Angio showed severe uncal herniation, downward tonsillar herniation, severe edema, and loss of global grey-white differentiation representing toxic metabolic injury versus hypoxic/ischemic injury. She was transferred to the ICU. Not considered a candidate for neurosurgical intervention. Toxicology was positive for amphetamines and cannabinoids/THC. 
Donor had a clinical history significant for diagnosis and treatment of chlamydia 6 months before admission. She had a cardiac echo done 4 years before admission following 3 episodes of syncope – normal intracardiac structure and function with mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflet tips without mitral regurgitation or prolapse. 2 year follow-up was suggested. Syncope was attributed to vaso-vagal response and poor diet and dehydration. She had a recent history of 102⁰F fever and cough due to cold 2 weeks before admission.

Labs showed elevated lipase consistent with pancreatitis. He had rhabdomyolysis and was hyperkalemic with evidence of acute kidney injury/severe renal insufficiency, possibly secondary to severe dehydration and severe DKA. He had recently undergone a left below knee amputation, which was not oozing but did not appear healthy. There was evidence of subacute bruising on right lower extremity – his mother reported that he had suffered a fall. Donor was in multi-organ and respiratory failure, as well as septic and acidotic. It was noted that sepsis was possibly related to osteomyelitis/cellulitis and could have triggered DKA. Chest X-ray showed bibasilar opacities, atelectasis, and cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion. Chest CT showed diffuse bowel wall thickening, tiny pancreatic calcifications compatible with chronic pancreatitis, mild fat stranding in upper abdomen adjacent to proximal duodenum and pancreatic head, gallbladder wall thickening, and a 5mm stone in left distal ureter with mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Head CT revealed diffuse cerebral/cerebellar edema compatible with brain death.

She was in a normal state of health until 3 days before admission, when she was found to have a blood sugar reading in the 500s. She mentioned to her mother that she had forgotten to take her evening insulin the night before and didn’t correct what she had eaten. She received corrected insulin and was reportedly fine all day, with blood sugars around 300 at noon and 189 by the evening. The following morning, she experienced stomach pain and mother believed her morning blood sugar was around 230. Donor took her insulin and carb corrected. In the afternoon, she was tired and complained of a headache and not feeling well. She was noted to have moderate ketones in her urine. The following day she vomited 2 times but was able eat and drink breakfast. Mother continued to push fluids and her blood sugars were running in the 200 to 300s during the day. She was still complaining of headaches for which her mother was treating with Tylenol. Donor’s mother was still concerned about her symptoms and called EMS that evening. They reportedly checked her vitals and said they were stable. Donor’s blood sugar when they arrived was reportedly 290. At the time, mother opted to not bring donor to the hospital due to concern about COVID risk. The following morning, donor was still vomiting and complaining of headaches. Mother treated nausea with Zofran. Donor was lethargic and dizzy. Mother says she spoke to donor’s endocrinologist and was told to double her correct dose of insulin and increase her Tresiba insulin from 35 to 40 units. Blood sugars remained mostly in the 300s during the day, but donor was noted to have high ketones in her urine. The night before admission, mother left briefly to run to the corner store to get gas. When she returned home about 15 minutes later, she says she found donor lying face down off the side of her bed and she was blue. EMS was called and arrived to find donor with no pulse and began compressions. They administered 3 rounds of epinephrine IV. They attempted intubation but were unsuccessful and therefore placed a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Upon arrival to the hospital, compressions were continued, IV access was obtained, 4th dose of epinephrine was administered, and ET tube was placed. No medications were needed during intubation. Donor had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Estimated downtime 15 minutes. Chest X-ray/Abdominal CT showed mild right greater than left perihilar opacities and mild spinal curvature. Also showed right posteromedial consolidation in the right lung base, infiltrates in the right upper lobe, and mild atelectasis in the posterior medial left lung base. Echocardiogram showed trivial regurgitation in the mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves and sinus tachycardia. Head CT revealed areas of diminished grey-white differentiation and complete effacement of the basilar cisterns and cerebral sulci, as well as crowding of the foramen magnum. Findings consistent with cerebral edema and resulting bilateral descending transtentorial herniation and tonsillar herniation patterns.

N/A	"Donor presented with neonatal insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) shortly after birth, and was found to have a gain-of-function STAT3 gene mutation associated with autoimmunity. He had immune thrombocytopenic purpura and received 2 bone marrow transplants. He underwent the first transplant at the age of 5. At the time, he had active autoimmune disease requiring steroids, and received a reduced-intensity matched unrelated bone marrow transplant with curative intent. He received his second transplant at the age of 6 following graft rejection after the reduced-intensity transplant. He underwent a myeloablative matched unrelated bone marrow transplant with curative intent. He was finally hospitalized for management of ascites and coagulopathy, but was ultimately placed on comfort care and died.
Donor had a clinical history of neonatal IDDM, which presented shortly after birth. He was found to have a STAT3 variant (C.1261G>A, p.G421R) gain-of function mutation, associated with ""Autoimmune disease, multisystem, infantile-onset, 1"" (ADMIO1) causing autoimmune enteropathy complicated by functional short gut syndrome – he was on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral feedings via gastrostomy tube. STAT3 mutation also caused central hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. He had a history of T1D without complications, treated with insulin pump. He also had immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pancytopenia, neutropenia, hypopituitarism, vitamin D deficiency, and anemia. He required multiple blood transfusions during hospital admissions, and had a history of febrile transfusion reaction. He also experienced recurrent Clostridium difficile infection during hospital admissions. He also had exocrine pancreas insufficiency, hypokalemia, migraines, and drug-induced hypertension.

He had developed a rash during the week before admission, and his mother brought him to urgent care. He stayed at the hospital for one night where he was diagnosed with Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and discharged with a prescription for methyl prednisone with instructions to start it only if the rash got worse. Rash worsened the day before terminal hospital admission so his mother gave first dose of prednisone. He had been awake and talking that morning but experienced a developing headache and photophobia. Mother was later called at work by a sibling who reported the donor was screaming due to the severity of the headache. Donor described headache as feeling like an electric current. Mother returned home to find he was agitated, combative, appeared angry, and began vomiting. He was somnolent and essentially unresponsive but was occasionally sitting up and attempting to grab things. Mother noted left mouth twitching, at which point the family called 911 and EMS brought donor into the ER. He was intubated upon arrival. Platelet count was 1, hemoglobin 10, and other coagulation factors normal. He underwent ITP therapy, involving methyl prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and multiple units of blood, platelets, FFP, and Factor 7. Chest X-ray/CT showed right basilar atelectasis, possible right effusion, pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia in right lung, and mild splenomegaly. Head CT revealed large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontal region measuring 7.6 x 5.6 cm, parenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 9 mm left to right midline shift.

She was taken emergently to the OR for right-sided decompressive hemicraniectomy and became hypotensive requiring multiple doses of epinephrine once dura was open. The surgeon closed quickly and she was transferred to the PICU for management of ICPs. Cardiac echo showed a small secundum atrial septal defect measuring 2.5 x 3mm, and physiologic pulmonary valve insufficiency. Chest X-ray showed bilateral airspace opacities thought to represent atelectasis or edema. Head CT revealed 6mm x 4mm extra-axial hemorrhage, favored to be subdural, but possibly epidural. Also showed thin subdural hemorrhage, right-sided mass effect with sulcal and ventricular effacement, and a non-displaced right occipital bone fracture. Toxicology was positive for benzodiazepines.

He reportedly ran out to greet his father who was returning home from work. Donor’s father heard him call out, but didn’t see him fall or trip in the driveway. The vehicle was going approximately 5mph when donor sustained head and abdominal trauma. CPR was initiated and he was transported to the hospital via ambulance. Upon arrival, CPR was continued. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved after 2 minutes, following 1 round of CPR and 1 dose of epinephrine, and he was intubated. He had a Glasgow Coma Score of 3T upon admission, with pupils 5-6 mm and fixed bilaterally, and he was actively bleeding from both nares. Unknown total downtime, but prolonged loss of consciousness was noted. He received multiple rounds of CPR before and during admission and was administered 2 half doses of epinephrine and 3 full doses, as well as CaCl, magnesium, LR, and sodium bicarbonate. He received multiple transfusions during admission: 13 units PRBCs, 11 units FFP, and 2 units of platelets due to acute blood loss. Chest X-ray showed 9 mm right pneumothorax, edema, bilateral pulmonary contusions, and right 5th and 6th rib fractures. Abdominal CT showed large grade 4 right hepatic lobe laceration with active arterial bleeding, a small perisplenic hematoma suggestive of a grade 1 splenic laceration, contracted gallbladder, and a small calcification near the cecum possibly representing appendicolith. Head CT revealed extensive cranial, skull base, and orbitofacial fractures including severely comminuted and displaced bifrontal skull fractures with depression of multiple fracture fragments intracranially, and right occipital skull fracture extending to temporal bone. Also revealed intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhages, pneumocephaly, diffuse cerebral edema with uncal and tonsillar herniations, large anterior interhemispheric pseudoaneurysm, and early left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) infarct. Surgery placed a chest tube in the ER to treat pneumothorax. Neurosurgery was consulted for a possible decompressive sub-occipital craniectomy, but it was not performed due to donor being deemed too unstable for neurosurgical OR – he lost pulses and CPR was again required. Achieved ROSC after 4 rounds of CPR and epinephrine. Transferred to PICU. Underwent a cerebral angiography with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) embolization of left ACA and associated pseudoaneurysm. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, with an open abdomen and wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) in place.

Donor also received 10mg sodium bicarbonate, and approximately 10cc of water was suctioned from his lungs. Once return of spontaneous (ROSC) was achieved, he was transferred to another hospital for further management of care. 60 minutes total estimated downtime/CPR. Approximately 17 minutes with no CPR administration. Chest X-ray/CT showed bilateral infiltrates suspicious for pneumonia, and streaky perihilar opacities. Head CT revealed severe bilateral cerebral and cerebellar edema consistent with acute cerebral anoxia. 
Donor had a clinical history of jaundice at birth – was hospitalized for 24 hours. He also had a history of eczema on his legs.
Donor had no previous surgical history.
Donor had a family history of depression – donor’s mother reported recent weight loss of 15 lbs. due to depression."	1.67999995e+00	\N	\N	Male	African Am	83.82	1.23000002e+01	1.75000000e+01	\N	\N	Yes	2020-07-08	13:25:00	2020-07-10	16:47:00	2020-07-12	06:22:00	2020-07-08	19:08:00	5.7166666666666668e+00	406	406	None	Donor: Daily multivitamins, protein shake as needed.

He had left his glucometer at home and was unable to check his glucose level. Family began driving him home, but he became increasingly lethargic so he was brought to the ER. Upon arrival, donor was in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. CPR was initiated and donor was intubated. After 1 dose of epinephrine, donor was in ventricular fibrillation. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved after 1 shock. Donor became bradycardic and more hypotensive until he had a second PEA arrest. This cycle repeated multiple times over the next hour, with donor achieving ROSC and then having successive bradycardic PEA arrests despite administration of epinephrine and norepinephrine. He eventually became hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the ICU. 4 total PEA arrests, 15 minutes downtime. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and atelectasis/consolidation. Head CT showed mass effect, loss of grey-white differentiation, diffuse effacement of the sulci, and severe swelling suspicious for tonsillar herniation, all suggestive of diffuse anoxic injury.
Donor had a clinical history of autoimmune polyglandular failure, including T1D (diagnosed 5 years prior to admission), Addison’s disease, and hypothyroidism. Clinical history also significant for autism, asthma, celiac disease, depression, and seizure disorder related to adrenal insufficiency. Donor had numerous hospitalizations for DKA due to non-compliance with insulin, and typically had an HbA1c above 14%.

She had severe hypotension, biventricular failure, severe coagulopathy, and pulmonary air trapping. She had gone to see her primary care provider after increasing fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion over the last year. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) 3 months before admission showed severe aortic stenosis, mild to moderate aortic insufficiency with minimum/peak 31/51mm Hg and an ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 5.5cm. Subsequent CT 2 days later showed ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 5.1cm. She was referred by her doctor to the hospital. She underwent a resection and replacement of her aortic valve with a 23mm Carpenter-Edwards bovine pericardial tissue valve the day after admission. Chest X-ray showed interstitial pulmonary edema, atelectasis, partial left lower lobe collapse, small left pleural effusion, possible trace right apical pneumothorax, and a nodule on the right lung base measuring 0.7cm. Chest X-ray also showed a widened superior mediastinum possibly related to post-surgical changes of median sternotomy and cardiac valve repair or mediastinal hematoma. Head CT revealed global hypoxic ischemic injury, diffuse cerebral edema with tonsillar herniation producing mass effect on brainstem, and hyperdense bilateral middle cerebral arteries. DCD donor.
Donor had a clinical history significant for recent diagnosis of ascending aortic aneurysm, severe aortic stenosis, and aortic insufficiency 3 months before admission.

He had last been seen well the night before. His mother called EMS, and on arrival they found donor on the floor but breathing, and with a pulse. At the time, donor was able to follow simple commands and answer yes or no questions. His blood glucose was 600, and his blood pressure was low at 80/43. He received 2L of normal saline, after which blood pressure improved to 100/77 and he became slightly more responsive. Donor was taken to the hospital, where labs showed a pH of 6.9, Na 113, K 7.0, blood glucose of 889, creatinine 1.77, and a white blood cell count of 32.41. Head CT at the hospital was negative and chest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis. He was admitted to the ICU for management of DKA. pH did not improve much, with highest recorded around 7.12. Donor later became bradycardic and went into respiratory arrest. CPR was started and he was given 1 dose epinephrine and 2 amps of sodium bicarbonate. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved after 4 minutes. Donor was intubated and taken for another head CT due to blown pupils and loss of reflexes post-code. Head CT showed anoxic injury with evidence of early herniation, pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage, and global cerebral edema with effacement of the basal cisterns. Donor was then transferred to another hospital for a higher level of care. He received 100mcg of fentanyl and 100g of mannitol en route. Vitals were stable during transfer and on arrival to hospital. Labs still showed pH of 7.08. DKA protocol was continued. pH normalized when brain death testing took place. Donor was placed on low dose Levophed and vasopressin along with a sodium bicarbonate drip in an attempt to correct prolonged acidosis. Levothyroxine and steroid protocol started after brain death declaration. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions, left basilar pneumonia, and bibasilar atelectasis. Abdominal CT showed fatty infiltrated liver and pancreas, and a small umbilical hernia. Repeat head CT revealed diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of the cortical sulci and basilar cisterns with decreased cerebral blood flow concerning for global hypoperfusion.
Donor had a clinical history significant for anxiety and schizophrenia, treated with medication – last saw psychiatrist a month before admission. Also had a history of headaches and heartburn. He had a branch fall on his head approximately 2 years before admission, requiring staples.

She had been to the ER the day before admission for a SARS-CoV-2 test after having 5 days of tactile fevers of unknown cause – test was negative and she was sent home. On day of admission, she seemed to be in her normal state of health, so her mother left her in front of the computer for schooling. When she returned, mom found her down and called 911. EMS arrived to find donor in asystole. They performed CPR and administered epinephrine x 2 for pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and defibrillated x 1 for pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VTach). King airway placed for ventilation. On arrival to the hospital, donor was in cardiac arrest with CPR in progress. She received epinephrine x 3, sodium bicarbonate 20 mEq x 3, and 800mL normal saline (40mL/kg). She was intubated with 5.5 endotracheal tube, placed on an epinephrine drip, and transferred to the pediatric ICU for continued care. Cardiac arrest/downtime 60 minutes, with 50 minutes CPR. Chest X-ray/CT showed moderate pneumomediastinum and pulmonary interstitial emphysema likely related to barotrauma. Also showed perihilar peribronchial thickening without focal consolidations suggestive of viral infection or reactive airway disease, as well as streaky infrahilar opacities likely representing atelectasis. Head CT revealed bilateral symmetric hypodensity of the basal ganglia, concerning for severe anoxic brain injury, and microcephaly with cerebral formation. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection – tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 multiple times during terminal hospital admission from nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. DCD case.
Donor had a clinical history of cerebral palsy (CP), seizure disorder, microcephaly, developmental delay, failure to thrive, gastroparesis, in utero demise of twin, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and previous COVID-19 infection.

She had recently been seen by her pediatrician for ear/upper respiratory infection and neuro exam, which was normal. Her mother had been bulb suctioning secretions from donor’s nares. Mother noticed donor arch her back, take a deep breath, turn a dusky color, and begin breathing “weird.” Paternal grandfather attempted breaths and reported no chest rise at first but then she had chest rise with more forceful breaths. Upon EMS arrival, donor was pulseless. She was intubated and EMS performed CPR in the field with an estimated 45-50 minutes downtime, with 5-6 doses of epinephrine given after arrival to the hospital. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved with note of agonal respiration over vent. Pupils were fixed and dilated, and donor had minimal response to pain. She was later transferred to another hospital. Chest X-ray showed bibasilar opacities and scattered atelectasis. Head CT/MRI showed findings of global anoxic injury with diffuse white matter hypodensity, loss of grey-white matter differentiation, and hyperdense cerebellum sign. 
Donor had a recent clinical history of ear/upper respiratory infection with fussiness and a low-grade fever. She was seen by her pediatrician 2 weeks before admission, who gave antibiotics and performed a neuro exam, which was normal. She had a rash 2 weeks before admission, thought to be due to medication reaction. Donor’s mother was breastfeeding – negative for any significant past medical or social history, and had seen her primary care physician for a checkup 2 months before donor’s admission.
